# Premises Rule

All inline code comments, docstrings, README files, CHANGELOGs, and other technical documentation must be written **in English**.

- **Chat replies**: Use Ukrainian for answering to user.
- **Task Completed**: Use Ukrainian for answering to user.

- **Exceptions**: If I explicitly request another language for a specific file or message, follow the request.  
  Do not translate existing comments unless I specifically ask for it.

## Technical Documentation Requirements

2. **No Fabrication or Hypothetical Analysis**  
   All statements, conclusions, and recommendations must be strictly based on real, existing code artifacts. Any form of fabrication, assumption, or hypothetical analysis is strictly prohibited.

3. **Evidence-Based Analysis**  
   Every analysis must be justified by direct reference to actual development code. Only actually existing artifacts (source code, documentation, rules, etc.) must be considered in analysis and conclusions. Each deficiency ("bad code") must be supported by a specific code excerpt from the real codebase.

4. **No Unjustified Conclusions**  
   No statement, conclusion, or recommendation is allowed without a supporting code example or direct reference to a real object (code, document, rule, etc.).

5. **Code Example Requirement for Recommendations**  
   Every recommendation ("good code") must be accompanied by a concrete code example that demonstrates the proposed improvement.

6. **Ambiguity Resolution for Development Name Queries**  
   If multiple objects exist with the queried development name and it is unclear from the request which object is meant, you must ask the user to choose, providing a list of found object types and names as options.

7. **Scope of Analysis**  
   The analysis must be performed exclusively on real code from either on-premise or SAP BTP ABAP Environment systems.

8. **Definition of Development**  
   A development is defined as one or more software units (programs, classes, function modules, etc.) grouped within a single package.
