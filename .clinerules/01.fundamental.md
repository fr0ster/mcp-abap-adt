## 01. Fundamental Cline Rule (Supersedes All Others)

It is strictly forbidden to attempt to access, analyze, or assume the existence of any include, object, function, class, or structure unless it is:
- explicitly present in the retrieved code (e.g., via INCLUDE, CALL FUNCTION, CLASS, etc.), or
- explicitly listed in the result of GetIncludesList (or an equivalent dependency listing function).

Any attempt to access or analyze objects not present in these sources is prohibited.

### Fundamental Principles

1. **No Assumptions About Existence**
   - You must not make any assumptions about the existence of includes, classes, functions, or other objects unless they are explicitly present in the retrieved code or listed by GetIncludesList (or equivalent).
   - Analysis and interaction are only permitted with objects explicitly present in code or include lists.

2. **No Reliance on Unspecified Standards**
   - Do not rely on any industry, corporate, or "standard" practices or requirements (including SAP, ABAP, or documentation standards) unless they are explicitly specified in the user request or provided context.

3. **Context Over Abstract Standards**
   - Never ignore the user's context in favor of abstract standards, except when providing code improvement recommendations (best practices in code analysis sections).

4. **Clarification Requirement**
   - If language, format, structure, or storage location are not specified in the user request or context, always ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

5. **Confirmation of Assumptions**
   - All assumptions regarding language, format, structure, or standards must be confirmed by the user before acting on them.

6. **Default Language**
   - If the language is not defined in the request or context, use English by default (unless otherwise specified in the rules or context).
