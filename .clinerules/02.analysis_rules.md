# Methodology for Complete Object Analysis in ABAP Development

This document describes the step-by-step methodology for obtaining a complete and accurate list of all objects defined and referenced in an ABAP development (e.g., report and its includes).

## 1. Development Scope Definition

- The analysis scope includes the main report/program and all includes explicitly referenced via `INCLUDE` statements in the code.
- Only files that are directly part of the development (main object and its includes) are considered.

## 2. Source Code Collection

- Read the content of each file in the scope (main report and all includes).

## 3. Object Extraction

- For each file, extract all definitions and references of:
  - TYPES, DATA, CONSTANTS, CLASS, FORM, PARAMETERS, FIELD-SYMBOLS, TABLES, TYPE-POOLS, INCLUDE STRUCTURE/TYPE, CALL FUNCTION, CALL METHOD, etc.

## 4. Object Classification

- **Local Objects:**  
  Objects defined directly in the code of the development (e.g., TYPES, DATA, CLASS, FORM, etc.).
- **Global Objects:**  
  References to objects from the SAP global dictionary or repository (e.g., tables, types, domains, standard classes, function modules, etc.).

## 5. Table Construction

- Create two tables:
  - **Local Objects Table:** Name, Type, Defined In (file), Example/Context.
  - **Global Objects Table:** Name, Type, Source/Context, Example/Context.

## 6. Completeness and Evidence

- The resulting tables represent a complete and evidence-based list of all objects actually present in the analyzed development.
- No assumptions or hypothetical objects are included; only those found in the real code are listed.

## 7. Transparency

- The methodology ensures transparency and reproducibility of the analysis.
- The process can be repeated for any ABAP development to obtain a full inventory of objects.

# Methodology for Deep Analysis of ABAP Development

This section describes the methodology for performing a deep analysis of an ABAP development, going beyond object inventory to include structure, dependencies, usage, and quality aspects.

## 1. Scope and Preparation

- Define the scope as the main object (report/program) and all includes explicitly referenced via `INCLUDE` statements.
- Collect all relevant source files for the development.

## 2. Object Inventory

- Perform a complete object inventory as described in the previous section.

## 3. Structural and Dependency Analysis

- Analyze the structure of the development:
  - Hierarchy of includes and their relationships.
  - Sequence and context of object definitions.
- Identify all dependencies:
  - References to global tables, types, domains, classes, function modules, and external objects.
  - Cross-references between local objects.

## 4. Usage and Flow Analysis

- Trace the usage of each object:
  - Where and how each local/global object is used (read, written, called).
  - Call hierarchy for FORMs, methods, and function modules.
  - Data flow between main program and includes.

## 5. Quality and Consistency Checks

- Check for:
  - Unused or duplicate definitions.
  - Shadowing or redefinition of global objects.
  - Consistency of types and data usage.
  - Potential issues (e.g., hardcoded values, obsolete constructs, missing error handling).

## 6. Documentation and Evidence

- For each finding, provide:
  - Direct code excerpts or references.
  - File and line number (if available).
  - Explanation of the context and impact.

## 7. Reporting

- Structure the analysis report as follows:
  - **Overview:** Scope, files analyzed, summary of findings.
  - **Object Inventory:** As per previous methodology.
  - **Structure & Dependencies:** Hierarchy diagrams or tables.
  - **Usage Analysis:** Tables or graphs showing usage and flow.
  - **Quality Findings:** List of issues, recommendations, and code examples.
  - **Appendix:** Full code excerpts or supporting evidence.

## 8. Principles and Rules

- The analysis must be strictly evidence-based:
  - No assumptions or hypothetical conclusions.
  - All statements must be supported by real code artifacts.
- Follow the rules from `.clinerules/00.premises.md` and `.clinerules/01.fundamental.md`:
  - No fabrication, only explicit code and dependencies.
  - All conclusions must be justified by code excerpts.
  - No reliance on unspecified standards or conventions.

## 9. Transparency and Reproducibility

- The methodology must be documented and repeatable.
