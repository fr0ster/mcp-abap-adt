# mcp-abap-adt Rules

## Language Requirements
All repository artifacts authored by the assistant (source code, documentation, comments, commit messages, etc.) must be written in English.

Direct communication with the user must follow the language used by the user in the current conversation.

## Project Context
- **Name:** mcp-abap-adt – MCP server for SAP ABAP ADT (ABAP Development Tools).
- **Purpose:** Provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with SAP ABAP systems.
- **Key Modules:** `src/handlers/`, `src/lib/connection/`, `src/lib/`, `tests/`

## Code Standards
- Source code: English only
- Comments: English only, explain "why" not "what"
- Variable/function/class names: English only
- Error messages: English only
- Log messages: English only

## Fundamental Cline Rules
- No assumptions about object existence unless explicitly present in retrieved code or listed by GetIncludesList
- No reliance on unspecified standards (SAP, ABAP, documentation standards) unless explicitly specified
- Context over abstract standards - never ignore user's context in favor of abstract standards
- Clarification requirement - always ask for clarification if language, format, structure are not specified
- Default language: English (unless otherwise specified)

## Architecture Notes
- Connection types: CloudAbapConnection, OnPremAbapConnection, BaseAbapConnection
- Handlers use centralized caching via `objectsListCache`
- Handlers return structured results (no file writes from handler logic)
- Testing: YAML-based configuration in `tests/test-config.yaml`
