# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Added dedicated `jest.setup.js` to skip automatic MCP server bootstrap during Jest runs, eliminating TDZ errors in the test environment.
- Narrowed Jest `testMatch` patterns to `*.test.[tj]s` and removed legacy CLI scripts from the suite to prevent false negatives.
- Updated `tests/integration/handleGetFunction.int.test.js` to accept either JSON or plain-text payloads and perform case-insensitive source assertions.
- Translated legacy inline comments and documentation references to English for consistency with project guidelines.
- MCP protocol compliance: All handler responses now strictly follow the MCP protocol.
- Removed all `mimeType` and `data` fields from handler responses.
- For type `"text"` in `content`, only the `text` field is used.
- For type `"json"` in `content`, only the `json` field is used.
- Unified response format for all handlers: `{ isError, content: [{ type: "text", text: ... }] }` or `{ isError, content: [{ type: "json", json: ... }] }`.
- Fixed all MCP client errors related to invalid response format.
- Updated documentation and handler tables to reflect new response format.
- Added two new tools for batch ABAP object type detection:
  - DetectObjectTypeListArray: accepts array of objects via 'objects' parameter.
  - DetectObjectTypeListJson: accepts JSON payload with 'objects' array via 'payload' parameter.
- Added documentation for both tools: see [doc/DetectObjectTypeListTools.md](doc/DetectObjectTypeListTools.md).
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New MCP tool: `DetectObjectTypeList`
  - Batch detection of ABAP object types by a list of names.
  - Input: `{ global: [{ name: string, type?: string }] }`
  - Output: `{ isError: boolean, content: Array<{ name, detectedType, description, shortText, longText, text, package, uri }> }`
  - Available via MCP API and web interface.
  - All comments and documentation in English.

### Changed
- All handler modules now use a unified in-memory caching mechanism via `objectsListCache`. This provides consistent, easily swappable cache logic across the codebase.
- The `filePath` parameter and all file write logic have been removed from all handlers. Handler results are now only cached in memory, not written to disk.
- This refactor improves maintainability, testability, and performance by eliminating redundant file operations and centralizing cache management.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- All MCP handler functions now support an optional `filePath` parameter. If provided, the handler will save the result to the specified file path (any absolute or relative path, with any extension).
- All CLI test scripts now accept the `--filePath=...` argument to save the result to a file.
- The result written to file is exactly what is returned to the user (no extra formatting or caching).
- Improved error logging and debug output for file writing operations.
- Updated documentation and usage examples in README.md to reflect new file output support.
- Implemented utility `writeResultToFile` for safe file writing with directory restriction and logging.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- Added integration test `tests/integration/handleGetFunction.int.test.js` for handleGetFunction.
- Significantly expanded integration test coverage in `src/index.test.ts` for all main tools (GetProgram, GetClass, GetFunctionGroup, GetFunction, GetTable, GetStructure, GetTableContents, GetPackage, GetInclude, GetTypeInfo, GetInterface, GetTransaction, GetEnhancements, GetSqlQuery, SearchObject).
- Added new checks for advanced scenarios (e.g., SQL generation, error handling, enhancement XML parsing).

### Changed
- Updated documentation regarding testing and integration scenarios.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-02

### Changed
- `GetWhereUsed` now supports any ADT object type (e.g. table/TABL, bdef/BDEF, etc.), not just class, program, include, function, interface, package.
- Updated documentation in README.md and jsdoc for supported object types and usage examples.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-19

### Added
- New `GetTransaction` tool to retrieve ABAP transaction details.
  - Allows fetching transaction details using the ADT endpoint `/sap/bc/adt/repository/informationsystem/objectproperties/values`.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-02-18

### Changed
- Added Jest Test Script `index.test.ts` available through `npm test`
- Enhanced `makeAdtRequest` method to support:
  - Custom headers through an optional parameter
  - Query parameters through an optional `params` parameter
- Improved `handleGetPackage` method to use ADT's nodeContent API
  - Now uses POST request with proper XML payload
  - Added specific content type headers for nodeContent endpoint
  - Added filtering to return only objects with URI 
- Improved CSRF token handling in utils.ts
  - Added automatic CSRF token fetching for POST/PUT requests
  - Enhanced token extraction to work with error responses
  - Added cookie management for better session handling
  - Implemented singleton axios instance for consistent state
  - Added proper cleanup for test environments

## [0.1.1] - 2025-02-13

### Added

  - Similar functionality to GetClass but for interfaces
  - Added documentation in README.md

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Initial release of the MCP ABAP ADT server
