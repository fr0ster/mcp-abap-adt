# mcp-abap-adt: Your Gateway to ABAP Development Tools (ADT)

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@mario-andreschak/mcp-abap-adt)](https://smithery.ai/server/@mario-andreschak/mcp-abap-adt)

This project provides a server that allows you to interact with SAP ABAP systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Think of it as a bridge that lets tools like [Cline](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) (a VS Code extension) talk to your ABAP system and retrieve information like source code, table structures, and more. It's like having a remote control for your ABAP development environment!

## Batch ABAP Object Type Detection Tools

Two tools are available for batch detection of ABAP object types:

- **DetectObjectTypeListArray**: Accepts an array of objects via the `objects` parameter.
- **DetectObjectTypeListJson**: Accepts a JSON payload with an `objects` array via the `payload` parameter.

See [doc/DetectObjectTypeListTools.md](doc/DetectObjectTypeListTools.md) for details and usage examples.

## üÜï What's New in BTP Branch

### Centralized In-Memory Caching (July 2025)

- All handler modules now use a unified in-memory caching mechanism via `objectsListCache`. This allows for consistent, easily swappable cache logic across the codebase.
- The `filePath` parameter and all file write logic have been removed from all handlers. Results are no longer saved to disk from handler logic; only in-memory caching is used.
- This change improves maintainability, testability, and performance by eliminating redundant file operations and centralizing cache management.

This branch includes several powerful new features:

- **üîç Enhancement Analysis Tools**: `GetEnhancements`, `GetEnhancementByName` - Comprehensive enhancement discovery and analysis
- **üìã Include Management**: `GetIncludesList` - Recursive include discovery and hierarchy mapping  
- **üöÄ SAP BTP Support**: JWT/XSUAA authentication with browser-based token helper
- **üíæ Freestyle SQL**: `GetSqlQuery` - Execute custom SQL queries via ADT Data Preview API
- **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration**: Configurable timeouts, flexible .env loading, enhanced logging
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Tools**: New testing utilities and improved error handling

This guide is designed for beginners, so we'll walk through everything step-by-step. We'll cover:

1.  **Prerequisites:** What you need before you start.
2.  **Installation and Setup:** Getting everything up and running.
3.  **Running the Server:** Starting the server in different modes.
4.  **Integrating with Cline:** Connecting this server to the Cline VS Code extension.
5.  **Troubleshooting:** Common problems and solutions.
6.  **Available Tools:** A list of the commands you can use.
