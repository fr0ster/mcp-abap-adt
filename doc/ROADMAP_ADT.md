# Roadmap: Improvements and Object Creation via ADT

## 1. Current State

- The system allows retrieving information about ABAP objects via ADT.
- Creation of new objects via ADT is not implemented yet.
- Main interactions are reading, searching, and structure analysis.

## 2. Improvement Paths

- Add support for object creation (classes, tables, functions) via ADT API.
- Implement templates for typical objects (e.g., class, structure, table).
- Add validation of input data before object creation.
- Add logging and messages for success/error during creation.
- Extend documentation with usage examples.

## 3. Possibility of Object Creation via ADT

- Study the ADT REST API for object creation (e.g., using POST requests to relevant endpoints).
- Investigate required parameters for each object type.
- Implement functions to generate payloads for different object types.

## 4. Roadmap

1. **Research ADT API**
   - ETA: 2025-07-10
   - Responsible: API Analyst
   - Dependencies: None
   - Study the official ADT REST API documentation.
   - Collect examples of object creation (classes, tables, functions).
   - Identify required permissions and possible API limitations.

2. **Implement Basic Object Creation (MVP)**
   - ETA: 2025-07-20
   - Responsible: Backend Developer
   - Dependencies: Research ADT API
   - KPI: Successful creation of class/table/function objects (≥90% success rate in tests)
   - Add functions for creating class, table, and function objects (minimal attributes/methods).
   - Add basic parameter validation.
   - Implement unit tests for object creation.
   - Subtasks:
     - Implement class creation
     - Implement table creation
     - Implement function creation
     - Validate minimal attributes

3. **Advanced Features**
   - ETA: 2025-07-31
   - Responsible: Backend Developer, QA
   - Dependencies: Implement Basic Object Creation
   - KPI: <5% error rate in advanced validation
   - Implement templates for typical objects.
   - Add advanced input validation (naming conventions, dependencies).
   - Add action logging and error handling.
   - Implement integration tests.
   - Subtasks:
     - Create templates for class, structure, table
     - Implement naming convention checks
     - Add dependency validation

4. **Documentation & Feedback**
   - ETA: 2025-08-05
   - Responsible: Technical Writer, Product Owner
   - Dependencies: Advanced Features
   - KPI: Documentation coverage 100%, ≥80% positive user feedback
   - Add usage examples for new functions.
   - Describe typical object creation scenarios.
   - Collect user feedback after initial release.
   - Update documentation based on feedback.
   - Documentation requirements:
     - Usage examples for each object type
     - Release notes for each milestone
     - FAQ and troubleshooting

5. **Release Planning**
   - ETA: 2025-08-10
   - Responsible: Product Owner
   - Dependencies: Documentation & Feedback
   - Define MVP scope (basic object creation, validation, unit tests).
   - Plan next releases (templates, advanced validation, integration tests).
   - Out of Scope:
     - UI for object creation
     - Support for custom ADT extensions

## 5. Definition of Done

- Each roadmap stage has clear acceptance criteria.
- All new features are covered by automated tests (unit, integration).
- Documentation is updated with relevant usage examples.
- User feedback is collected and analyzed after each release.
- CI/CD pipeline is updated to include new tests and linting.
- Security checks are performed for all new features.
- Success metrics (e.g., number of created objects, error rate, user satisfaction) are defined and tracked.

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

- Changes in ADT API: Monitor SAP updates, design for adaptability. **Mitigation:** Schedule monthly API review, modularize API integration.
- Insufficient permissions: Document required roles, provide error messages. **Mitigation:** Add permission checks, detailed error reporting, documentation for admins.
- Complex object dependencies: Start with simple cases, incrementally add complexity. **Mitigation:** Implement dependency graph, add warnings for missing dependencies.
- Lack of user adoption: Gather feedback early, iterate on UX. **Mitigation:** Conduct user surveys, organize feedback sessions, adjust roadmap based on feedback.
- Potential security issues: Perform code reviews and vulnerability scans. **Mitigation:** Integrate automated security scans into CI/CD, enforce code review checklist.
- Delays in documentation: Assign dedicated technical writer, set intermediate deadlines.
- Communication gaps: Establish regular status meetings, maintain changelog and release notes.

## 7. Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and update roadmap based on feedback and metrics.
- Schedule periodic retrospectives to identify process improvements.
- Encourage contributions and suggestions from the community.
- Communication plan:
  - Publish release notes for each milestone.
  - Send user surveys after major releases.
  - Maintain open feedback channel (e.g., email, issue tracker).
