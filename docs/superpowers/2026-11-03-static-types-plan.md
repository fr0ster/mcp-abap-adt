# Plan: static types in the server's production code

Goal: `2026-11-03-static-types-goal.md`. Spec: `2026-11-03-static-types-spec.md`. The spec
binds, and each step names the spec section it carries out. Every step ends green:
- build, test:check and the root `npm test`;
- every package's `lint:check` and `test:check`.

## Baseline

1. **Capture fixtures before any change** (spec §2, §7). Commit them before anything else:
   - every tool's listed JSON schema, per binary variant (`tools/list` of each of the twelve
     bins);
   - `tool-search.json`.
2. **Count the implicit `any`.**
   - Switch `noImplicitAny` on locally, record the error count per package and file, then
     switch it back.
   - The list goes into this plan as an appendix. It is the scope of step 12.
3. **List the undeclared keys.** Find every target handler that reads a key its own schema
   does not declare (spec §3), and add each to the appendix.

## Tool arguments (spec §2)

4. **Prove the typing in a typecheck** (`__typechecks__`), in this order:
   1. a zod `inputSchema`;
   2. `defineTool` answering an entry whose `call` takes `ToolArgs`;
   3. the entry registering on the SDK, the callback's arguments typed `z.output`;
   4. that output after `.extend` (state handle) and `.omit` (`background`, `timeout`).

   **Decision point:**
   - If item 4 holds, the SDK's parse is the only one.
   - If not, the closure parses with the entry's schema. Measure the batch timing test before
     and after.

   Record the outcome in this plan.

   **Outcome** (measured 2026-11-03 with zod 4.6.7, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.32.1,
   TypeScript 6.0.3; `src/__tests__/typecheck/toolArgs.typecheck.ts`, compiled by `test:check`):
   - **1 holds.** `z.output` of a `z.object` is the argument type, not `any`.
   - **2 holds.** `defineTool<S extends z.ZodObject>(definition, handler)` answers an entry whose
     `call(context, args: Readonly<Record<string, unknown>>)` parses with
     `definition.inputSchema.safeParse(args)`: its `data` is typed `z.output<S>` inside the generic
     closure, so the handler is called with no cast. Entries of different argument types share one
     `HandlerEntry[]`, and a handler of another schema, or of a wrong argument type, is refused.
   - **3 holds for a schema of a known type, not inside a generic `defineTool`.** With a concrete
     schema, `registerTool`'s callback gets `z.output` of it, typed. With the generic `S`, the
     callback is refused: `error TS2345: Argument of type '(args: z.output<S>) => Promise<…>' is
     not assignable to parameter of type 'BaseToolCallback<…>'` (the SDK's `ToolCallback<S>` is a
     conditional type left unresolved for a generic `S`); unannotated, `args` is
     `Record<string, unknown>` and `handler(context, args)` is refused: `Argument of type
     'Record<string, unknown>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'output<S>'`.
   - **4 holds for a schema of a known type, not for a generic one.** Concrete: the output after
     `.extend({ state_handle })`, `.omit({ background, timeout })` and both reaches the handler typed
     (`state_handle` taken out by destructuring). Generic: after `.extend` the rest is
     `{ [x: string]: unknown; }` and after `.omit` `Record<string, unknown>`, each refused as the
     handler's argument: `error TS2345: Argument of type '{ [x: string]: unknown; }' is not
     assignable to parameter of type 'output<S>'`. A generic `.omit` also takes a key the schema
     does not have, unchecked; a concrete one refuses it (`TS2353`).
   - **What compiles for the registry:** the entry's schema held as `z.ZodObject`, edited by
     `.extend` / `.omit` as `z.ZodObject`, registered with a callback whose `args` (a record of
     unknown values, not `any`) go to `entry.call`, which parses with the entry's own schema.

   **Decision (per the decision point above):** item 4 does not hold for the generic entry, so the
   closure parses with the entry's schema: the SDK parses with the listed schema, `call` parses
   again. The batch timing test is to be measured before and after (step 5).

   **Timing of the second parse** (steps 5–7):
   - The batch timing test (`src/__tests__/integration/batch/batchedReadsTiming.test.ts`) is an
     integration test on a SAP system; it was not run, before or after. It calls the handlers
     directly, not an entry's `call`, so it would not time the second parse either.
   - Measured instead (2026-11-03, the worktree's `dist` after step 7, node, mean of 20 000
     `safeParse` calls after 2 000 warm-up ones): `GetClass` 0.20 µs, `CreateTableType` 0.45 µs,
     compact `HandlerGet` 1.23 µs per call. Before step 7 a call had no second parse (0 µs).
5. **Change the contract.**
   - The new `ToolDefinition`, `HandlerEntry` and `defineTool`, and `registerTool` taking an
     entry.
   - Remove `ArgsOnlyHandler`, `isArgsOnly`, `callInItsForm` and the context swapping.
   - Rewrite the variant projections, `withStateHandle` / `withoutStateHandle`,
     `withoutBackground` / `withoutTimeout`, the docs generator and the tool-search generator
     over zod (`z.toJSONSchema`).
6. **Migrate the 325 definitions to zod, by handler directory.**
   - Each directory is one commit.
   - The listed-schema fixture of step 1 must match after each. A difference is fixed in the
     migration, not in the fixture.
7. **Register every group through `defineTool`.** ReadOnly, System, HighLevel and the low
   groups pass their context at the call. Delete `jsonSchemaToZod`, `shapeOf`, `typeOf` and
   `ArgsOf`.

## Compact (spec §3)

8. **Tests first, one per refused case.** For each compact read, part and write route, a
   wrong-typed argument that passes today is refused with the schema's words. An undeclared
   key from step 3 is declared in its schema first.
9. **Each compact read and part route becomes the target entry's `call`.** The write handlers
   take their typed arguments and call the target's `call`. Remove the `as never`.

## The rest (spec §4)

10. **`IAdtResponse`.**
    - Typed literals and narrowing everywhere.
    - The server's `StepError` as `TError`.
    - `IAnalyse<any>` becomes `IAnalyse`.
    - `CheckedDeletable` and `IAdtVersionable` take their bound types.
11. **XML reader module** `src/lib/xml/tree.ts`.
    - Tests first, over corpus documents, for each predicate.
    - Move every reader onto it, by strategy file.
12. **Implicit and explicit `any`**, by package, from step 2's list:
    - `catch (error)` as `unknown` through the failure readers;
    - the logger types;
    - `@types/express` and the express-typed exports;
    - index reads as tuples or checked reads;
    - the two `@ts-expect-error`;
    - `scripts/`.
13. **Delete the `canRefreshToken` and `__debugId` branches.**

## The gate (spec §5)

14. **The Jest source scan, with its fixtures.**
    - One fixture per refusal: assertion, `any`, `!`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`,
      `biome-ignore`.
    - `as const` and test files stay allowed.
    - It must pass on the code as it is now.
15. **Switch the rest on.**
    - Remove `noImplicitAny: false` from every `tsconfig`.
    - Biome: pin it exactly, set the three rules as errors on every production directory and
      `scripts`, and widen `lint:check` and the build's check to the same directories.
16. **Prove the gate is load-bearing.** Put one `as unknown as`, one `any` and one
    `@ts-expect-error` back. Watch the scan, Biome and `tsc` go red, then revert.

## Release

17. **Version 24.0.0 for every package.**
    - `MIGRATION-24.0.md` (spec §6).
    - CHANGELOG with the fixes of §3 in their own lines.
    - README and `docs/` wherever a handler, a definition or `registerTool` is shown.
    - `npm run docs:tools`.
## Test coverage (spec §8)

The stage runs after step 17 and before step 18. It is written as tasks C1–C16, each with its
own steps. The open items at the end of this section wait for the owner's decision before the
task that needs them starts.

**Global constraints.** Every task's requirements include these:
- **Commands.** npm scripts only. Never `npx`, `npm exec`, `node_modules/.bin` or `ts-node`.
- **Integration runs.**
  - Name the files with `npm run test:integration -- --listTests <path>` first. Then run the
    script with the path, not with another `--testPathPatterns` / `--testPathIgnorePatterns`,
    because those replace the script's own.
  - Ask the owner before any run that reaches a SAP system.
  - Before a run that may log on through a browser, ask which browser and profile to use, and
    wait for "ready".
- **Test code.** No regex. No built-in timeout or retry. No cast: the static-types scan applies
  to the new helpers' production-style code, and tests add none.
- **Committed text.** Tool descriptions stay functional. No system name, system id, transport
  number or user name in a committed file.
- **Every task ends green,** except the guard test of C1. It is red from C1 until C16 lands and
  lists the keys still missing; see open item O1. Green means:
  - build, `npm run test:check` and the root `npm test`;
  - every package's `lint:check` and `test:check`.
- **Expected request literals** come from running the code on the stand-in. They are reviewed
  in the diff against the corpus (`tests/fixtures/adt/`) and the ADT contract. There is no
  freezing harness.
- **A defect a pin or a live case shows is fixed in this PR,** in this order: a failing test
  first, then the fix, then a CHANGELOG line (spec §8, acceptance 4).

**Review focus.**
1. A pin recorded from wrong code becomes the expected value. Read every literal in the diff
   against the corpus answer of the same endpoint, before accepting it.
2. Onprem and cloud take different code. A key that requires both systems needs one pin per
   variant, not one shared case. The guard checks the `variant` field against the key's
   required kinds.
3. A live case can pass while asserting nothing: a call that answers `isError: false` on a
   no-op. Each live case reads its effect back.
4. A config section missing from the owner's file makes its suites skip. The run report and
   `globalTeardown` (C2) turn such a skip into a failure.
5. Cleanup can touch objects a person owns.
   - Each name is read before its create; a name that already exists fails the case.
   - Cleanup deletes only recorded names.
   - C1's `live.ts` tests prove that a name which already existed is never deleted.

**Every family task (C3–C16) follows the same steps.** A task lists only its own files, keys
and live specifics.
- [ ] **Write the pin rows red.** Add the family's `pinCases` rows with `expected: []`. Run
  `npm test -- <unit file>`. It fails: `pinCases` refuses an empty `expected` and prints the
  recorded requests.
- [ ] **Fill the literals.** Fill each `expected` from that run, then review each request
  against the corpus. A request that is wrong is a defect: its own failing test, the fix, a
  CHANGELOG line.
- [ ] **Run green.** Run `npm test -- <unit file>`: PASS.
- [ ] **Write the live cases.** Use `liveSuite`, `liveCall` and `expectAbsent`, plus the
  family's template section (`enabled: true`, `available_in` as the keys require). Run
  `npm run test:integration -- <live file>` without a config: every case skips, naming its
  reason.
- [ ] **Add the ledger rows.** Add the family's rows to `coverage-ledger.json`. Run
  `npm test -- src/__tests__/unit/coverage/coverageLedger.test.ts`: none of the family's keys is
  reported missing or orphaned.
- [ ] **Run the family live.** With the owner's go, after the realm check (C2), run the
  family's live file on the on-premise system, then on the cloud system. Every required key
  passes, and nothing the test did not create is touched.
- [ ] **Commit** the family as `test(coverage): <family> pinned and live`.

### C1. The guard ledger (red)

**Files:**
- Create:
  - `src/__tests__/helpers/servedTools.ts`, extracted from `toolSet/listedSchemas.test.ts`.
    That test then imports it.
  - `src/__tests__/helpers/pinCases.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/integration/helpers/live.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/unit/coverage/coverageKeys.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/unit/coverage/ledgerScan.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/unit/coverage/coverageLedger.test.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/unit/coverage/__fixtures__/coverage/*`
  - `tests/fixtures/tools/coverage-ledger.json`, starting as `{}`.

**Interfaces (produced):**
- **`servedTools.ts`**
  - `type SystemKind = 'onprem' | 'cloud'`
  - `interface ServedTool { name: string; variant: SystemKind; binary: string; schema: ListedSchema }`
  - `servedTools(): Promise<readonly ServedTool[]>`: `tools/list` of all twelve binaries for
    both variants.
- **`coverageKeys.ts`**
  - `type CoverageKey = string`, in the form `Tool`, `Tool#OBJECT_TYPE` or
    `HandlerGet#OBJECT_TYPE#part`.
  - `requiredKeys(served: readonly ServedTool[]): ReadonlyMap<CoverageKey, ReadonlySet<SystemKind>>`.
    The `object_type` values come from each listed schema's enum. The `HandlerGet` pairs come
    from `compactReadRoutes` / `compactPartRoutes`.
- **`pinCases.ts`**
  - `interface PinnedRequest { method: string; url: string; headers: Readonly<Record<string, string>>; body: string | undefined }`
  - `interface PinCase { tool: string; object_type?: string; part?: string; variant: SystemKind; stand: 'recording' | 'adtStandIn'; args: ToolArgs; answers?: ReadonlyArray<Partial<IAdtWireResponse> | undefined>; refusal?: true; expected: readonly PinnedRequest[] }`
  - `pinCases(cases: readonly PinCase[]): void`
    - It defines one `it('<key> (<variant>) sends the pinned requests')` per case.
    - It finds the entry by name among the variant's served entries. An unserved tool fails.
    - It calls `entry.call(context, args)` over the chosen stand.
    - It asserts `expected` non-empty, the recorded list `toEqual(expected)`, and the answer's
      `isError` (`true` only with `refusal`).
- **`live.ts`**
  - `liveSuite(systems: readonly SystemKind[], title: string, body: () => void): void`.
    Without a config, or on a system it does not name, it skips and logs the reason.
  - `liveCall(tool: string, args: ToolArgs): Promise<LiveAnswer>`
    - soft mode: the entry's `call`; hard mode: the MCP tool;
    - it refuses before sending once the run's credential-refusal marker exists;
    - it records the key and the outcome in the run report.
  - `expectAbsent(read: { tool: string; args: ToolArgs }): Promise<void>`
  - `recordCreated(deleteTool: string, args: ToolArgs): void`
  - `deleteRecorded(): Promise<void>`, for `afterEach`.
  - `expectNameFree(read: { tool: string; args: ToolArgs }): Promise<void>`
- **`ledgerScan.ts`**
  - `scanUnitFile(path: string): readonly PinRef[]`
  - `scanLiveFile(path: string): readonly LiveRef[]`
  - Both use the TypeScript compiler API only (`ts.createSourceFile`, a node walk).

**Steps:**
- [ ] **Step 1: Write `coverageLedger.test.ts`.**
  - `'the served list is the listed-schema fixture'`: the set of names equals the keys of
    `listed-schemas.json`, and its size is 315.
  - `'every required key has a ledger row'` and `'every ledger row is a required key'`: two set
    differences, each expected `[]`, with the missing keys printed.
  - `'each row names exactly the systems its key requires'`.
  - `'each unit reference is a pinCases row of that key'`: `scanUnitFile(row.unit)` holds a ref
    with an equal key and a variant per required kind.
  - `'each live reference is a liveCall of that key in an it, inside a liveSuite naming the system'`.
  - `'a delete key's live case calls expectAbsent after the delete'`.
  - `'no pinCases row or liveCall in a scanned file lacks a ledger row'`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write one fixture per refusal and a test that each is refused,** each by its
  own check alone. The refusals:
  - a missing row;
  - an extra row;
  - a missing system;
  - an extra system;
  - `expected: []`;
  - a spread or computed request;
  - a non-literal `url`;
  - a request with a fifth key;
  - a `liveCall` in `afterEach`;
  - a `liveCall` in a cleanup lambda;
  - a `liveCall` outside `liveSuite`;
  - a delete without `expectAbsent`;
  - an orphan `liveCall`;
  - a unit file under `integration/`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Write `pinCases`' own unit tests** (`src/__tests__/unit/coverage/pinCases.test.ts`).
  - `'refuses an empty expected'`.
  - `'refuses a tool the variant does not serve'`.
  - `'fails when one request more is recorded than expected'`.
- [ ] **Step 4: Write `live.ts`' own unit tests** (`src/__tests__/unit/coverage/live.test.ts`), on
  `adtStandIn`, so nothing reaches SAP:
  - `'liveCall sends nothing after the refusal marker'`;
  - `'deleteRecorded deletes only recorded names'`;
  - `'expectNameFree fails on an existing name and deletes nothing'`.
- [ ] **Step 5: Implement the six files** to the interfaces above.
- [ ] **Step 6: Run.** `npm test -- src/__tests__/unit/coverage`. The
  fixtures, `pinCases` and `live.ts` tests PASS. The ledger test FAILS, listing every required
  key as missing (the red baseline). Record the count in this plan.
- [ ] **Step 7: Mutate each check.** Delete it, see its fixture's test go red, then revert.
- [ ] **Step 8: Commit** as `test(coverage): the ledger guard, red`.

### C2. Live-run safety and the run report

**Files:**
- Modify:
  - `src/__tests__/integration/globalSetup.ts`
  - `tests/test-config.yaml.template`: `environment.expected_realm: ""` with its comment.
  - The integration Jest configuration: add `globalTeardown`.
- Create:
  - `src/__tests__/integration/helpers/realmCheck.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/integration/helpers/runReport.ts`
  - `src/__tests__/integration/globalTeardown.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- **`realmCheck.ts`**
  - `realmCheck(kind: SystemKind, baseUrl: string, expectedRealm: string, session: SessionFacts): Promise<void>`
  - It sends an unauthenticated `GET <baseUrl>/sap/bc/adt/discovery` and expects `401`.
    - On premise, the `WWW-Authenticate` realm must equal `expectedRealm`; empty refuses.
    - On the cloud, the session's JWT `exp` must lie in the future. It is decoded locally.
  - Any mismatch throws.
- **`runReport.ts`**
  - `reportPath(): string`, under the OS temp directory and named per run, never in the
    repository.
  - `recordOutcome(key: CoverageKey, kind: SystemKind, outcome: 'passed' | 'failed' | 'skipped'): void`
  - `markCredentialRefused(): void`
  - `credentialRefused(): boolean`

**Steps:**
- [ ] **Step 1: Write the unit tests** (`src/__tests__/unit/coverage/realmCheck.test.ts`, on a
  local HTTP stand-in):
  - `'a wrong realm throws before any credential is sent'`: the stand-in records no
    `Authorization` header;
  - `'an empty expected realm refuses'`;
  - `'an expired JWT refuses with no request'`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Write the teardown tests** (`src/__tests__/unit/coverage/runReport.test.ts`):
  - `'teardown fails when a required key of this system was skipped'`;
  - `'teardown passes when every required key passed'`.
- [ ] **Step 3: Implement.**
  - `globalSetup` calls `realmCheck` before it builds the factory.
  - `liveCall` calls `markCredentialRefused` on a credential refusal: a logon `401`, or a broker
    refusal.
  - `globalTeardown` compares the run report with `coverage-ledger.json` for the configured
    system kind.
- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests above:** PASS. Without a config, `npm run test:integration` still
  returns at once, logging nothing on.
- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** as `test(coverage): realm check, refusal stop, run report`.

### C3. Activate

**Keys:**
- `ActivateBehaviorDefinition`, `ActivateClass`, `ActivateDataElement`, `ActivateDdl`,
  `ActivateDomain`, `ActivateFunctionGroup`, `ActivateFunctionModule`, `ActivateInclude`,
  `ActivateInterface`, `ActivateMetadataExtension`, `ActivateObjects`, `ActivateProgram`,
  `ActivateServiceBinding`, `ActivateServiceDefinition`, `ActivateStructure`, `ActivateTable`,
  `ActivateTableType`: 17.
- `HandlerActivate#<type>`: 18 types on premise, 16 on the cloud.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/activate.pins.test.ts`, on `recordingConnection`. Each
activation answer is a corpus activation result.

**Live:** `src/__tests__/integration/coverage/activate.live.test.ts`, section `coverage_activate`.
- **Objects.** One inactive object per type, created by the test without activation. Its
  dependencies are read from `shared_dependencies` and never written: the CDS root of a BDEF,
  the DDL behind a metadata extension, the service definition behind a binding, the function
  group behind a module.
- **Assertions.** After the activation, `GetInactiveObjects` no longer lists the object, and
  the activation result has no error.
- **Cleanup.** `deleteRecorded`.
- **Systems.** Include and program on premise only; the rest on both.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C4. Check and validate

**Keys:**
- `CheckBehaviorDefinition`, `CheckClass`, `CheckDataElement`, `CheckDdl`, `CheckDomain`,
  `CheckFunctionGroup`, `CheckFunctionModule`, `CheckInterface`, `CheckMetadataExtension`,
  `CheckPackage`, `CheckProgram`, `CheckStructure`, `CheckTable`, `CheckTableType`: 14.
- `HandlerCheckRun#<type>` and `HandlerValidate#<type>`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/check.pins.test.ts`.

**Live:**
- The existing `high/check/CheckHighHandlers.test.ts` moves its calls to `liveCall`, keeping
  its sections (`check_*_high`).
- New: `coverage/check.live.test.ts`, for the compact keys and `CheckTableType`, section
  `coverage_check`.
- **Objects.** Shared objects only: read, never written, so nothing is created and no cleanup
  is needed.
- **Assertions.** The check-run report is read and has the object's URI.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C5. Create and update (full)

**Keys:**
- Every `Create*` and `Update*` full tool but the unit-test, transport and binding-update
  ones: 21 creates and 25 updates. The unit-test tools are C12's, `CreateTransport` /
  `CreateTransportTask` are C13's and `UpdateServiceBinding` is C14's.
- This includes the live gaps: `CreateDdl`, `UpdateDdl`, `CreateMessageClass`,
  `CreateMessageClassMessage`, `UpdateMessageClass`, `UpdateMessageClassMessage` and
  `UpdatePackage`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/write.pins.test.ts`.
- Each update is pinned on its whole locked chain: lock, write, unlock.
- The creates already pinned by parity are pinned again here, by literal (open item O2).

**Live:**
- **The existing `high/<type>/*HighHandlers.test.ts`.** Create, update and read-back move into
  the test body through `liveCall`. `HighTester` keeps only the failure cleanup, through
  `deleteRecorded`.
- **New: `coverage/ddlAndMessageClass.live.test.ts`,** section `coverage_writes`: a DDL, a
  message class with one message, and an update of a package the test created.
- **Assertions.** Every update is read back and compared with what was written.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C6. Compact writes per object type

**Keys:** `HandlerCreate#<type>`, `HandlerLock#<type>`, `HandlerUpdate#<type>` and
`HandlerUnlock#<type>`, each over the types its variant's enum lists.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/compactWrites.pins.test.ts`. The 112 rows of
`lowToCompact.test.ts` stay. The types they leave out get pins here: `TABLE_TYPE`, `INCLUDE`,
`SERVICE_*`, `BEHAVIOR_*`, `METADATA_EXTENSION`, `TRANSPORT`.

**Live:** `coverage/compactWrites.live.test.ts`, section `coverage_compact_writes`.
- It is enabled in the template and runs in soft mode. The hard-mode
  `batch/communicationBatch.test.ts` stays as it is.
- **Flow.** Per type: create, lock, update, unlock, read back. Each step is a `liveCall` in the
  body. Every lock is released in the same test.
- **Assertion.** A lock left behind fails the case. It is never cleared by SM12.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C7. Deletes

**Keys:**
- Every `Delete*` full tool: 27, `DeletePackage` included.
- `HandlerDelete#<type>` and `HandlerDeletionCheck#<type>`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/delete.pins.test.ts`. The deletes already pinned by parity
are pinned again here by literal (O2).

**Live:**
- **Full tools.** Each `<type>` suite of C5 ends its test body with `liveCall('Delete<Type>', …)`
  and then `expectAbsent`.
- **`DeleteServiceDefinition`.** Its local wrapper in `ServiceDefinitionHighHandlers` goes; the
  test calls the tool.
- **Compact keys.** `coverage/compactDeletes.live.test.ts`, section `coverage_compact_writes`.
  Per type it runs `HandlerDeletionCheck`, then `HandlerDelete`, then `expectAbsent`.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C8. Reads

**Keys:**
- **`Get<Type>`:** the 25 tools whose metadata part `batch/metadataReads.test.ts` pins by
  parity (`GetBehaviorDefinition` … `GetTableType`), each listed in the ledger.
- **Other readers:** `GetEnhancementImpl`, `GetEnhancementSpot`, `GetEnhancements`,
  `GetInclude`, `GetIncludesList`, `GetFunctionInclude`, `GetPackageContents`,
  `GetPackageTree`, `GetObjectsList`, `GetStructuresList`, `GetTypeInfo`, `GetLocalDefinitions`,
  `GetLocalMacros`, `GetLocalTestClass`, `GetLocalTypes`, `GetMessageClassMessage`,
  `GetMainPrograms`, `ListFunctionGroupIncludes`, `ListFunctionModules`.
- **Compact:** `HandlerGet#<type>#<part>`, every pair the route tables serve, except the
  unit-test pairs (C12).

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/read.pins.test.ts`. The source part is pinned by literal as
well as the metadata part, which `metadataReads.test.ts` pins only by parity.

**Live:**
- **Existing read suites** move their calls to `liveCall`.
- **New: `coverage/reads.live.test.ts`,** section `coverage_reads`.
  - **Objects.** Shared objects only (`shared_dependencies`), read and never written. The
    enhancement spot and implementation are named in the section; open item O7.
  - **Assertions.** Each read answers the named object: its name and type in the answer, and
    the source is not empty.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C9. Version tools

**Keys:**
- The 28 generated `Get<Type>Versions` / `Get<Type>VersionSource` / `Get<Type>VersionDiff`.
- `GetObjectVersions`, `GetObjectVersionSource`, `GetObjectVersionDiff`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/versions.pins.test.ts`. The version feed and the source
answers are corpus documents.

**Live:** `coverage/versions.live.test.ts`, section `coverage_versions`.
- **Objects.** One object per type with at least two versions, named in the config and only
  read. Which objects is open item O3.
- **Assertions.**
  - The version list has at least two entries.

- Compact: `HandlerUnitTestRun`, `HandlerUnitTestStatus`, `HandlerUnitTestResult`,
  `HandlerCdsUnitTestStatus`, `HandlerCdsUnitTestResult`, `HandlerGet#UNIT_TEST#*`,
  `HandlerGet#CDS_UNIT_TEST#*`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/unitTests.pins.test.ts`.

**Live:**
- **The existing `unitTest/*` suites** move to `liveCall`. `RunAbapUnit` and the compact keys
  get cases there, on the class the suite creates.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/transport.pins.test.ts`.

**Live:**
- **The existing `TransportObjectToolsCrud`** moves to `liveCall`.
- **New: `coverage/transport.live.test.ts`,** section `coverage_transport`.
  - **Objects.** A transportable package named in the section; `$TMP` cannot be recorded.
    The test creates a request and a task, and adds and removes an object it created.
  - **Never** release a request.
  - **The request and task remain:** open item O4.
  - **Cloud:** open item O5.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C14. Service binding

  `ListServiceBindingTypes`.
- Compact: `HandlerServiceBindingListTypes`, `HandlerServiceBindingValidate`.
- `Create`, `Activate`, `Get` and `Delete` of a binding are C5, C3, C8 and C7.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/serviceBinding.pins.test.ts`.

**Live:**
- **The existing `ServiceBindingHighHandlers`** calls `UpdateServiceBinding` as its update step,
  with the publish state read back. It no longer uses `ActivateServiceBinding` for that.
- The remaining keys go in the same file.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

- **Compact:** `HandlerDebugSession`, `HandlerDebugBreakpoints`, `HandlerDebugStep`,
  `HandlerDebugMaintain`, `HandlerDebugBatch`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/debugger.pins.test.ts`, on `adtStandIn`: the listener and
the debuggee run on connections of their own.

**Live:** the existing `debugger/DebuggerHandlers.test.ts` moves to `liveCall` and gains
cases, section `debugger_handlers`.
- **New cases:**
  - watchpoints: create, list, delete;
  - breakpoint list and delete;
  - `DebugSetStackPosition`;
  - `DebugSetVariable`, read back;
  - `DebugTerminate`;
  - `MemorySnapshotGet` and `MemorySnapshotDelta`;
  - `AmdpDebugSetBreakpoints` and `AmdpDebugCancel`;
  - the compact debug tools.
- **Objects.** The probe class the suite creates and deletes, and the shared AMDP pair, read
  only.
- **Connections.**
  - The debuggee runs on its own connection.
  - The take-over case uses a second connection of the same user.
  - The other-user case uses `second_user_env` on its own connection.
- **`afterAll`** stops every listener and logs off every session (`debuggerCleanup.ts`).
- **Open item O9** covers the take-over connection and AMDP without HANA.

**Steps:** the family steps. 7.

### C16. Batch, sessions, background runs, leftover sessions

**Keys:**
- `BatchBegin`, `BatchEnd`, `BatchAnswers`, `HandlerBatch`.

- `ListLeftoverSessions`, `LogoffLeftoverSession`, `HandlerLeftoverSessionList`,
  `HandlerLeftoverSessionLogoff`.

**Unit:** `src/__tests__/unit/pins/sessions.pins.test.ts`, on `adtStandIn`. This covers the
four compact handlers no test runs today.

**Live:** `coverage/sessions.live.test.ts`, section `coverage_sessions`.
- **Batch.** Two reads in one envelope, both answered.
- **Long sessions.** The HTTP launcher (`launch_http`). The session is opened, used for one
  read and closed, then the closed handle is refused.
- **Background runs.** `RuntimeRunClass` with `background: true` on a probe class the test
  creates. The run is got, listed and discarded, and the discarded run is absent from the list.
- **Leftover sessions.** Open item O10.

**Steps:** the family steps, then:
- [ ] Turn the guard green: `npm test -- src/__tests__/unit/coverage/coverageLedger.test.ts`
  PASS with no key missing.
- [ ] Commit.

8 steps in all.

### Open items (owner's decision before the task that needs them)

- **O1. The guard is red during the stage.**
  - The plan keeps it red from C1 to C16, so CI on the PR is red that long.
  - Alternative: land it as `test.failing` and switch it to `test` in C16. CI stays green, but
    the missing-key list is hidden until then.
  - Recommendation: keep it red, as the owner asked ("red first"). Push each family as it
    lands.
- **O2. Re-pin keys already pinned by parity, by literal.**
  - `createSingleCall`, `metadataReads`, `lowToCompact` and the other parity files pin "request
    equals another path's request", not a literal. The guard sees only `pinCases`.
  - Recommendation: re-pin every key in `pinCases`, keeping the parity tests. This is uniform,
    cheap from the stand-in run, and closes the half-pinned rows the inventory counts as PINNED.
  - The alternative, teaching the scanner each parity table, couples the guard to those
    files' shapes.
- **O3. Version tools need objects with two or more versions.** We never release a transport,
  so an object the test creates in `$TMP` has no version history.
  - Recommendation: read-only objects with a history. On premise, one SAP-delivered object per
    type, named in `coverage_versions`.
  - On the cloud this is to be measured first. For a type without such an object, the owner
    decides.
- **O4. `CreateTransport` / `CreateTransportTask` leave a request behind.** No tool deletes
  one, and none may be released.
  - Recommendation: one request and one task per run, each with a fixed test description and
    emptied by `RemoveTransportObject`. The run report lists them for the owner.
- **O5. Transport tools on the cloud trial.** Its development package has no transport, and
  the existing suite is on premise only.
  - Recommendation: measure first whether the trial can create a request.
  - If not, the owner decides whether `available_in: cloud` is a defect to fix (spec §8,
    acceptance 4) or an exception.
- **O6. Profiler state.** `RuntimeCreateProfilerTraceParameters` and the profile runs leave
  trace files and parameters, and no tool deletes them.
  - Recommendation: accept them as the trace of the test user's own run, listed in the run
    report. A shared system's other users' traces are never read.
- **O7. Enhancement reads on the cloud.** `GetEnhancementImpl` / `GetEnhancementSpot` are listed
  on the cloud.
  - Recommendation: measure on the trial for an enhancement object to read. If there is none,
    the owner decides as in O5.
- **O8. `GetSqlQuery` / `GetTableContents` on the cloud.** Listed there, live on premise only
  today.
  - Recommendation: run them on the cloud against a table of the test package. If the trial
    refuses data preview, decide as in O5.
- **O9. The debugger's second connection, and AMDP without HANA.**
  - Take-over needs a second listener of the same user. Recommendation: a second connection of
    the same user, opened and logged off by the test.
  - The AMDP keys need HANA. Recommendation: run them on the cloud and on a HANA on-premise
    system. If the on-premise system is not on HANA, the owner decides whether its AMDP keys
    are an exception.
- **O10. Leftover-session tools need a leftover session.**
  - Recommendation: the test makes its own.
    1. It starts the stdio binary on its destination and opens a session.
    2. It ends the process without logoff.
    3. It lists through a new process and logs off only the session it made, matched by its
       id. A leftover it did not make is listed, never logged off.
  - The SAP logoff can take minutes to show, so the test asserts the tool's answer, not SM04.
- **O11. Compact tools with an `action` enum** (`HandlerDebug*`, `HandlerSession`,
  `HandlerBatch`, the background-run and leftover tools).
  - The spec keys them by tool only.
  - Recommendation: add `action` as a key dimension, read from the listed schema like
    `object_type`, so each action is pinned and live.
- **O12. Missing config sections.** The owner's `tests/test-config.yaml` lacks the include,
  table-type and check sections. Without them those suites skip, and C2's teardown fails the
  run.
  - Recommendation: before step 18, copy those sections from the template, plus every
    `coverage_*` section, with the owner's approval of the values.
  - Their names go into the PR description.

## Live runs and release

18. **The full integration run on both systems,** after the realm check. Every
    integration suite, the coverage suites included, runs once on the on-premise system and
    once on the BTP trial system, each with the owner's go:
    - `npm run test:integration 2>&1 | tee <log outside the repository>`;
    - the log and the run report stay outside the repository.
    - **Pass:** `globalTeardown` reports no required key skipped or failed on that system.
    - **After a failure:** fix it with a failing test first, then rerun that system whole.
    - The counts per system go into the PR description, with no system name.
19. Run CI's full step list locally, including the pack, the install check and the images.
    Then run Codex review and CI, and get the owner's review.
20. Delete the goal, spec and plan before the release commit. Put anything they owe into the
    PR description: the open items' outcomes, the exceptions the owner granted, the per-system
    run counts and the config sections the owner's file needed. Then wait for the owner's merge and tag, the publish, and the registry
    check.

## Appendix A — implicit any

Measured (step 2): `"noImplicitAny": false` removed from the 13 tsconfigs that state it (the root
`tsconfig.json`, and `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.test.json` of `background-runs-memory`,
`responsible-rules`, `server-runtime`, `server`, `http` and `sse`), each package's `test:check` run
(the root's covers `src`, `scripts`, `server-runtime/src` and every `compact*` and `*-ro` package),
then switched back. With it off, every `test:check` is clean, so every error below comes from the
switch. An error a package's run reports in another package's file is counted once, at that file.

| Package | Production: errors (files) | Tests: errors (files) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/lib` (`src`, `scripts`) | 5 (3) | 34 (7) |
| `server-runtime` | 2 (2) | 6 (6) |
| `http` | 0 | 1 (1) |
| `sse` | 0 | 1 (1) |
| `background-runs-memory`, `responsible-rules`, `server` | 0 | 0 |
| every `compact*` and `*-ro` package | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **7 (5)** | **42 (15)** |

By code: TS7016 (module without types: `express`) 15, TS7053 (implicit `any` index) 5, TS7006
(implicit `any` parameter) 5, TS2339 24 (one site, below).

Production:

- `src/embeddable/IHttpApplication.ts:1` — TS7016 `express`.
- `src/lib/httpTransport/dnsRebindingProtection.ts:1` — TS7016 `express`.
- `src/lib/strategies/projections.ts:176, 202, 230` — TS7053: a key indexed on `{}` (the
  `Terse<any>` readers' XML values).
- `server-runtime/src/http/StreamableHttpServer.ts:43` — TS7016 `express`.
- `server-runtime/src/sse/SseServer.ts:42` — TS7016 `express`.

Tests:

- `src/__tests__/admin/shared-deps/setup.test.ts:1720` — TS2339, 24 errors at one site: a key read
  from a four-key literal, one error per member of the key's union.
- `src/__tests__/unit/httpTransport/tlsServer.test.ts:4, 29, 64` — TS7016 `express`, and four TS7006
  (`_req`, `res`).
- `src/__tests__/unit/cancel/cancelNothingToSap.test.ts:26`, `src/__tests__/unit/cancel/notToTool.test.ts:25`
  — TS7016 `express`.
- `src/__tests__/unit/connectionLoggerChannel.test.ts:31` — TS7053.
- `src/__tests__/unit/embeddable/plainRegistration.test.ts:546` — TS7006 `e`.
- `src/__tests__/unit/resultSets.test.ts:29` — TS7053.
- `server-runtime/src/http/__tests__/{headerCredentials,healthEndpoint,systemContextOrder}.test.ts`,
  `server-runtime/src/sse/__tests__/{headerCredentials,healthEndpoint,systemContextOrder}.test.ts` —
  TS7016 `express`, one each.
- `http/src/__tests__/exports.test.ts:26`, `sse/src/__tests__/exports.test.ts:26` — TS7016 `express`.

Inference, not measured: while `express` has no types, every value typed by it (`Request`,
`Response`, `NextFunction`, the `express()` app) is `any` without an error, so adding
`@types/express` (step 12) may show further errors in the files that use them.

## Appendix B — undeclared keys

Measured (step 3) by reading the code: every handler a compact route or a compact tool hands the
model's arguments to — the read and part routes (`compactReadRoutes`, `compactPartRoutes`), the
address and run parts of `handleHandlerGet`, the write handlers (`handleCreateOnly`,
`handleUpdateUnderLock`, `handleDeleteOnly`) and each per-type target they call, and every other
`Handler*` tool of `compact-readonly-entries` and `compact-modify` with the handler it calls. For
each, the keys it reads from its arguments (`args.x`, `args['x']`, destructuring, `detailOf(args)`
for `detail`, the dynamic reads of `CLASS_INCLUDES` and `DELETION_NAME_FIELDS`) against the
properties of the schema it is listed with (the step 1 fixture; a tool no binary lists, from its
`TOOL_DEFINITION`).

**A target reads a key its own schema does not declare:**

1. `handleGetObjectStructure` (`src/handlers/system/readonly/handleGetObjectStructure.ts:209-210`)
   reads `object_type` and `object_name` as the fallbacks of `objecttype` and `objectname`. Its
   schema (`GetObjectStructure`) declares `objecttype` (required), `objectname`, `detail`.
   `HandlerGet`'s `part: 'object_structure'` passes exactly `{ object_type, object_name }`
   (`handleHandlerGet.ts:81-84`). Validated against `GetObjectStructure`'s schema, both are
   dropped and `objecttype` is missing: the route must pass `objecttype` / `objectname`, or the
   schema declare the two.
2. `handleGetUnitTestResultOnce` and `handleGetCdsUnitTestResultOnce`
   (`src/handlers/unit_test/shared/resultOnce.ts:38-50`, `readResultOnce`) read `run_id`,
   `detail`, `with_navigation_uris` and `format`. They are reached from `HandlerGet` (`UNIT_TEST`,
   `CDS_UNIT_TEST`) and from `HandlerUnitTestResult` / `HandlerCdsUnitTestResult`.
   - The `TOOL_DEFINITION` of their module, `GetUnitTestResult`, declares `run_id` and `detail`
     only; `GetCdsUnitTestResult` declares all four.
   - `compactUnitTestResultSchema` (both compact result tools) declares `run_id`,
     `with_navigation_uris`, `format`, not `detail`.
   - `HandlerGet`'s schema declares `run_id` only of the four.
   - No tool's entry has the `…Once` function as its handler with a schema of these four, so the
     `UNIT_TEST` / `CDS_UNIT_TEST` routes cannot be "the target tool's entry" as they are (step 9).
   - The full `handleGetUnitTestResult` (same module, line 40) reads `with_navigation_uris` and
     `format` too, which `GetUnitTestResult` does not declare.
3. `handleCreateOnly` (`src/handlers/common/low/handleCreateOnly.ts`) reads `detail` (`ALWAYS`,
   `detailOf` in `createAlone` and the `INCLUDE` branch); `HandlerCreate` declares no `detail`, so
   over MCP it is always dropped and the answer always terse.
4. `handleUpdateUnderLock` reads `part` for every type (`partRefusal`, line 106). `HandlerUpdate`
   declares `part` on onprem, not on cloud.

**`detail` read by a target, not declared by the compact tool that hands it the arguments**
(declared by the target's own tool; over MCP the compact path is always terse):
`HandlerTransportCreate` → `handleCreateTransport`, `HandlerTransportMoveObjects` →
`handleMoveTransportObjects`, `HandlerTransportSortAndCompress` →
`handleSortAndCompressTransportTask`, `HandlerServiceBindingValidate` →
`handleValidateServiceBinding`, `HandlerUnitTestStatus` → `handleGetUnitTestStatus`,
`HandlerCdsUnitTestStatus` → `handleGetCdsUnitTestStatus`, and the two result tools of item 2.
`HandlerGet` declares no `detail` either; of the targets it reaches, `GetPackage`,
`ReadTransportObjects`, `GetVirtualFoldersLow`, `GetObjectStructure` and the two `…Once` result
reads read it, each declaring it in its own schema.

**Checked, every key declared by the target's own schema:** `GetPackage`, `GetDomain`,
`GetDataElement`, `ReadTransportObjects`, `GetTable`, `GetStructure`, `GetTableType`, `GetDdl`,
`GetServiceDefinition`, `GetServiceBinding`, `GetClass`, `GetLocalTestClass`, `GetLocalTypes`,
`GetLocalDefinitions`, `GetLocalMacros`, `GetProgram`, `GetInclude`, `GetInterface`,
`GetFunctionGroup`, `GetFunctionModule`, `GetBehaviorDefinition`, `GetBehaviorImplementation`,
`GetMetadataExtension`, `GetMainPrograms`, `GetPackageContents`, `GetServiceBindingPreviewUrl`,
`GetVirtualFoldersLow`, `GetNodeStructureLow`; `CreatePackage`, `CreateTransport`, `CreateTable`,
`CreateDdl`, `CreateClass`, `CreateProgram`, `CreateInclude`, `CreateInterface`,
`CreateFunctionModule`; `UpdateTableLow`, `UpdateStructureLow`, `UpdateDdlLow`, `UpdateClassLow`,
`UpdateProgramLow`, `UpdateInterfaceLow`, `UpdateFunctionModuleLow`,
`UpdateBehaviorDefinitionLow`, `UpdateMetadataExtensionLow`; `SearchObject`, `GetWhereUsed`,
`GetSqlQuery`, `GetTableContents`, `RuntimeCreateProfilerTraceParameters`,
`ListServiceBindingTypes`; `handleDeleteOnly` against `HandlerDelete`; every `Handler*` tool's
own reads against its own schema.

**No schema of their own:** `handleGetActivationStatus` / `handleGetActivationResults` (read
`run_id`, called with `{ run_id }` built by `HandlerGet`), `handleStartUnitTestRun` (reads what
`HandlerUnitTestRun` declares), `handleDeletionCheck` (reads `object_type`, `object_name`, both
declared by `HandlerDeletionCheck`).

**Values:** every target with a `part` lists `source` and `metadata`, the two values the compact
passes it; a target without `part` drops it.

How it was read, and its limit: the keys come from the handlers' source, by reading each
target and a scan of its module for `args.x`, `args['x']` and destructuring; a key a helper of
another module reads from a passed `args` was followed only for `detailOf`, `readPartOf`,
`readResultOnce` and the in-module helpers named above.
